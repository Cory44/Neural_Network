# Neural Network
######A from scratch Neural Network using the MNIST handwritten digit datatbase for training

This is a simple Neural Network, built completely by me. The goal of the Neural Network is to identify hand written digits. I have used the MNIST handwritten digit database to train the network.

Specs of the newtork
- 784 input nodes (28 x 28 pixel images of digits)
- 16 node hidden layer
- 10 node output layer

Special Thanks
